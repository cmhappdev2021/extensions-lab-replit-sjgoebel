/*:
 ## Exercise - Extensions
 Define an extension to `Character` that includes a function `isVowel()`. The function returns `true` if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), and `false` otherwise. Be sure to properly handle uppercase and lowercase characters.
 */


/*:
 Create two `Character` constants, `myVowel` and `myConsonant`, and set them to a vowel and a consonant, respectively. Use the `isVowel()` methods on each constant to determine whether it's a vowel.
 */


/*:
 Create a `Rectangle` struct with two variable properties, `length` and `width`, both of type `Double`. Below the definition, write an extension to `Rectangle` that includes a function `half()`. This function returns a new `Rectangle` instance with half the length and half the width of the original rectangle.
 */


/*:
 Within the existing `Rectangle` extension, add a new mutating function `halved()` that updates the original rectangle to have half the length and half the width. Use the `half()` function as part of the implementation for `halved()`.
 */


/*:
 Create a variable `Rectangle` called `myRectangle`, and set its length to 10 and its width to 5. Create a second instance, `mySmallerRectangle`, that's the result of calling `half()` on `myRectangle`. Then update the values of `myRectangle` by calling `halved()` on itself. Print each of the instances.

/*:
 ## App Exercise - Workout Extensions
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 Add an extension to the `Workout` struct below and make it adopt the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol.
 */
struct Workout {
    var distance: Double
    var time: Double
    var averageHR: Int
}
/*:
 Now create another extension for `Workout` and add a property `speed` of type `Double`. It should be a computed property that returns the average meters per second traveled during the workout.
 */


/*:
 In the second extension to `Workout`, add a `harderWorkout` method that takes no parameters and returns another `Workout` instance. This method should double the `distance` and `time` properties and add 40 to `averageHR`. Create an instance of `Workout` and print it to the console. Then call `harderWorkout` and print the new `Workout` instance to the console
